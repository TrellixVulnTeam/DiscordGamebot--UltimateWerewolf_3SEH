# DiscordGamebot--UltimateWerewolf
Discord Bot to moderate the game Ultimate Werewolf on a server.

**Note that this requires a private bot token to function** 
This can be acquired from the Discord Developer Portal by making a bot to handle this code.
Currently, the token is protected by using the .env package, so after you get the token, be sure to make a .env file with the line 
BOT_TOKEN=[insert-token-here]

Right now, seer and bodyguard have been implemented and are currently being tested. 
Role cards will be added after testing.

Thanks for reading, have fun!
